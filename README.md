# DOM Submarine ⚓

**A tactical DOM parsing framework inspired by naval doctrine and submarine operations.**

---

## Mission Overview

DOM Submarine is not just a parser—it's a vessel. A hunter-class tactical system designed to infiltrate the hostile waters of modern web applications, detect semantic targets, and extract meaningful content with precision. This framework draws heavily from the operational discipline of the United States Navy, adapting its crew structure, terminology, and mission-critical mindset to the digital battlespace.

## Why Naval Doctrine?

Modern web environments are volatile, complex, and often adversarial. Parsing them requires more than brute force—it demands **discipline**, **modularity**, and **strategic thinking**. The U.S. Navy has spent decades refining protocols for operating in extreme conditions, managing specialized crews, and executing high-stakes missions. These principles translate seamlessly to software architecture:

- **Chain of Command** → Clear module responsibility
- **Redundancy & Resilience** → Modular fallback systems
- **Environmental Conditioning** → DOM volatility handling
- **Mission-Critical Thinking** → Strategic parsing, not just scraping

Whether you're parsing a Shadow DOM or managing memory under load, you're facing the same challenges submariners do: limited visibility, hostile terrain, and the need for precision under pressure.

The universality of disciplined systems thinking can be applied in cross-domain operational doctrine, and as such we draw upon the experience and expertise of the US Military's Office of the Chief of Naval Operations (OPNAV) and their published instructional materials (OPNAVINST) to apply it to this domain.

## Framework Structure

The project is organized around a **crew directory**, where each file represents a submariner role (using Navy acronyms) and contains the tools and duties that role would perform.

### 🧭 Crew Manifest (`crew/`)

| File        | Role                          | Responsibilities                                  |
|-------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `cob.py`    | Chief of Buffer               | Manages rolling buffer and flush logic            |
| `sts.py`    | Sonar Technician Submarines   | Tracks tag depth, semantic zones, and echo logic  |
| `ft.py`     | Fire Control Technician       | Scores nodes and locks onto semantic targets      |
| `ht.py`     | Hull Maintenance Technician   | Filters noise, strips SVGs and utility classes    |
| `xo.py`     | Executive Officer             | Coordinates parser operations                     |
| `co.py`     | Commanding Officer            | Orchestrates mission and crew                     |

Each officer may operate multiple tools (classes), and each tool is designed to reflect the real-world duties of its namesake.

## Learning by Immersion

This framework is designed to teach **DOM parsing and naval systems simultaneously**. By anchoring terminology in Navy doctrine, developers gain:

- A mental model rooted in operational clarity
- A deeper appreciation for modular design
- Exposure to real-world systems thinking

Even if you've never served, you're learning from the best. The Navy's research into crew management, environmental resilience, and mission execution applies directly to software teams, construction crews, and digital operations.

## Tactical Philosophy

> "Discipline is the soul of an army. It makes small numbers formidable."  
> — George Washington

DOM Submarine embodies this philosophy. It’s not about brute force—it’s about precision, coordination, and mission focus. Every module has a role. Every class has a duty. Every operation is logged, scored, and executed with intent.

> "It's not a Memo, it's a mission statement."
> — Jerry Maguire

 🎙️ "Who's coming with me, man?" — Drop the hatch and fire up the reactor, Captain. This isn’t just a parser, and it’s not just a project. It’s a mission. A declaration. A doctrine. A call to arms for anyone who’s ever stared into the abyss of a tangled DOM and said, “I need more than a scraper. I need a crew.”.
